## Product Packaging Tips for Product Builders  

### 1. Define the Problem Clearly
Identify the core problem your product solves. Be concise and specific. Ask:  
- What pain points does this solve?  
- Who is the primary audience?

Example: "UpskillPM addresses the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical experience in product management."

### 2. Craft a Unique Value Proposition
Explain what makes your product unique and valuable. Use a simple formula:  
> *For [target audience], [product name] is a [category] that solves [problem] by [solution].*

Example: "For aspiring product managers, UpskillPM is an online school that bridges learning with real-world practice through AI."

### 3. Outline Key Features and Benefits 
List core features with a focus on how they benefit the user.  Example: 
- Feature: Hands-on internships  
- Benefit: Gain real-world experience to build job-ready skills.

### 4. Keep It Simple 
Use clear, jargon-free language. Focus on outcomes rather than processes.

### 5. Highlight Social Proof 
Include testimonials, success stories, or statistics.  
**Example:** "Kate, an UpskillPM alumna, landed a management role in AI after completing the program."

### 6. Call to Action (CTA) 
End with a clear next step for the user.  
- Sign up, join the community, or start a free module.
